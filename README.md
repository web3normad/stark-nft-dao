# AI-Powered Decision-Making for NFTs and DAO Treasuries on StarkNet

## Introduction
The NFT market is oversaturated, making it challenging for collectors and investors to identify valuable assets. Simultaneously, DAOs struggle with treasury management due to market volatility, inefficient staking strategies, and suboptimal token allocations. This project introduces an AI-powered agent within the StarkNet ecosystem to solve these challenges through predictive insights and automated decision-making.

## Problem Statement
### 1. NFT Discovery and Curation
- The NFT market is oversaturated, making it difficult to identify valuable assets.
- Current discovery methods rely on social trends or manual research, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.
- There is no personalized AI-driven curation tool specifically optimized for the StarkNet ecosystem.

### 2. DAO Treasury Optimization & Predictive Tokenomics
- DAOs face challenges in treasury management due to market volatility, inefficient staking strategies, and suboptimal token allocations.
- Traditional financial tools do not consider blockchain-specific dynamics such as liquidity mining incentives, staking rewards, or token lock-up mechanisms.
- DAOs lack AI-driven insights for proactive decision-making on treasury allocations, staking, and rebalancing.

## Solution
This project introduces an AI agent that operates within the StarkNet ecosystem, offering two primary functionalities:

### 1. NFT-Focused AI Agent
- Uses AI to analyze on-chain data and market sentiment to recommend NFTs tailored to user preferences.
- Predicts potential performance of NFTs based on past trends and AI-driven sentiment analysis.
- Helps users discover undervalued or high-potential NFTs before they gain traction.

### 2. Predictive Tokenomics for DAOs
- Trains AI models on DAO financial data and market patterns to predict token price movements.
- Provides optimized staking strategies for DAOs based on AI-generated insights.
- Enables automatic rebalancing of treasury portfolios based on real-time market shifts.
- Offers smart allocation recommendations, ensuring DAOs maximize yield while minimizing risk.

## Implementation & Frontend Features
### Eliza-based Frontend with Custom Modifications
- The frontend is built on the Eliza framework with modifications for NFT discovery, DAO treasury management, and AI-driven insights.
- Users interact with the AI agent through a clean and intuitive UI.

### Wallet Connect as Authentication
- Users authenticate with their StarkNet wallet instead of traditional login methods.
- Enables seamless interaction with smart contracts for treasury rebalancing and NFT transactions.
- Ensures security and decentralization, reducing reliance on centralized authentication systems.

## Scalability & Potential
### Scalability
- The AI agent can be extended to support more asset classes beyond NFTs, such as DeFi positions and other tokenized assets.
- Can integrate with multiple DAOs, offering customized treasury strategies per DAO.
- AI models improve over time with more StarkNet ecosystem data, increasing accuracy.
- The system can expand to other blockchains if needed.

### Brilliance of the Idea
- **High-value use case**: Addresses two major Web3 challengesâ€”NFT discovery and DAO financial optimization.
- **AI-driven insights**: AI-powered decision-making is underutilized in DAOs and NFT markets.
- **StarkNet-first innovation**: Establishes the project as a unique offering within the StarkNet ecosystem, making it attractive for funding and partnerships.
- **DeFi + NFTs + AI = Strong Narrative**: Aligns with current Web3 trends, ensuring high adoption potential.
